# Left-Handedness Analysis

This repository contains Python code for analyzing left-handedness based on death distribution data and reported rates of left-handedness. The code includes data visualization and probability calculations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/left-handedness-analysis.git
cd left-handedness-analysis
```

Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the left-handedness analysis.
2. Ensure an internet connection to fetch the necessary data from the provided URLs.
3. View the generated plots and explore the probability calculations.

## Code Structure
- **left_handedness_analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code.
- **left_handedness_analysis.py**: Python script with the same functionality as the Jupyter Notebook.
- **requirements.txt**: File specifying required Python libraries.

## Data Sources
1. Left-handedness data: [lh_data.csv](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mbonsma/8da0990b71ba9a09f7de395574e54df1/raw/aec88b30af87fad8d45da7e774223f91dad09e88/lh_data.csv)
2. Death distribution data: [cdc_vs00199_table310.tsv](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mbonsma/2f4076aab6820ca1807f4e29f75f18ec/raw/62f3ec07514c7e31f5979beeca86f19991540796/cdc_vs00199_table310.tsv)

## Functionality
1. Visualize left-handedness data by age and sex.
2. Explore the distribution of left-handedness over birth years.
3. Calculate the probability of being left-handed given an age of death.
4. Analyze death distribution data for the United States in 1999.
5. Calculate the overall probability of being left-handed based on death distribution data.
